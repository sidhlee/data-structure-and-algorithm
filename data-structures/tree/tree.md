# Tree Data Structure

A Tree is a data structure consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship. Unlike the list, trees are non-linear where many paths can branch of from a single parent. We can think of a tree as a special case of tree where parents have maximum one child.

## What is NOT a tree

- sibling nodes connected to each other.
- a child node having more than one parent.

## Tree Terms

- root - a top node in a tree.
- child - a node connected to other node closer to the root.
- parent - a node connected to other node(s) farther from the root.
- siblings - nodes with the same parent.
- leaf - a node with no children.
- edge - a connection between nodes.
