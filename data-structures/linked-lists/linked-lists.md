# Linked Lists

A Linked List is a data structure that has head, tail and length.
Linked List consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

## List vs Array

### Lists

- Indices not available
- Nodes are connected with `next` pointer
- Random access not allowed
- Faster mutation due to the lack of indexing

### Array

- Indexed
- Insertion/deletion can be expensive due to re-indexing
- Can access specific item faster with index
