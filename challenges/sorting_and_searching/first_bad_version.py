"""
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1

        move the right pointer to include the latest bad version.
        when we get out of the loop, it's either:
        1. right comes to the left
            - mid was bad
            - right comes to mid and mid was at the left
              - mid is left when left and right are next to each other

            - right was at mid + 1

        TLDR;
        - Keep target included in the range while narrowing it down.
        - When the left and right meet, it should still include the target.
