"""
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, 
and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, 
but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, 
where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged,
and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Hint #1  
You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time
rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted.
What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution?

Hint #2  
If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays
and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution.
