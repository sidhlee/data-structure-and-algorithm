"""
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

        - either the last or second last house is robbed
        - either we skip 1 house or 2 houses to make max profit
        - either we start from first or second house

        Start looping from the last house, and keep updating the cache with
        the sum of the current value and the the value of i + 2 or i + 3 whichever is greater.
        1. Store the index:value pair to the cache.
        2. If index + 2 exists in cache, store the sum of current value and the value of index + 2
        3. If index + 3 exists in cache, store the sum of current value and the max between i + 2 or i + 3
        4. After the loop is done, return the bigger value from i or i + 1 from the cache
