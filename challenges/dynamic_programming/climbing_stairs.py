"""
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2

Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3

Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45

Hint1:
To reach nth step, what could have been your previous steps? (Think about the step sizes)

        At every decision point we can either step or skip -> "binary decision tree"
        - Each non-null leaf counts as 1 and we stop either at 1 or 0
        - At every node, the # of possibilities is the sum of possibilities from left and right child.
        - There are duplicates of the same sub-trees -> use memoization.
