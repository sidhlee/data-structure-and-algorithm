"""
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

        starting from index 1 and looking back is a good way to avoid index out of range exception
        when you're comparing neighboring values in the same array.

        Exploit the requirement:
        - Because we can sell and buy again immediately, we can keep selling as long as today's price is higher than yesterday's,
        and immediately buy again at the today's price.
        - The requirement only cares about the maximum profit one can make regardless of how many transaction one makes.
        This assumes the best possible scenario where the one buys the stock at the first bottom and sell at the top before hitting the
        end of array.
