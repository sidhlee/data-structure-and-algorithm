Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

Example 1: 
'./valid_sudoku_1.png'

Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. 
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

        In order to figure out how to use i and j to create the lists of subgrids,
        it was helpful to write out examples like this to see and get the intuition.

        [00 01 02 10 11 12 20 21 22]
        [03 04 05 13 14 15 23 24 25]

        [36 37 38 46 47 48 56 57 58]

        We can use nested loop since we have small upper bound.

        2022-08-18 08:59:46
        But this solution creates all lists to loop upfront even though we could return early.

        You don't need to wait till the all lists are completed.
        - Use set to find existing number with O(1).

        Couldn't remember adding to a set to check duplicates inside the loop
        -> this should be faster because we're returning false as soon as possible
        without filtering through the whole array. (wouldn't make much difference because len(arr) is always 9)
        -> this also allows to loop through the subgrid and validate value by value.

        Interestingly this approach is up to par with the above solution,
        probably because the size of the list is constant at 81.
