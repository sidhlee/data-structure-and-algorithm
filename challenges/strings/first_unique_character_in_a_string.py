Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

        If we're not returning early (i.e. we have to finish looping at least once),
        we don't need to manually save it to the dict.
        Instead, we can turn them into a counter.

        Also, we don't care about the indices of the duplicates. We just need to check
        if the character shows up more than once. so appending index to the list is not necessary.

        We return the index from the original string, so it make sense to iterate
        through the original string and stop where the counter has the only one occurrence.
        -> we're still returning early so it's <= O(2n)
