"""
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 27
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: n = 9
Output: true

Constraints:

-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
