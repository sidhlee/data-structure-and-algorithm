"""
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path 
from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
'./max_depth_of_binary_tree_1.jpeg'

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Hint1
- you need to consider perfectly unbalanced tree where there are only left/right children.

        Recursively call with left and right child.
        Return 0 when reaching the null.
        From one level up, take the larger value of the left and right children
        and add 1 for itself (this also applies to the leaf node).

        This method use DFS and increments max_depth during the backtracking.
        It always takes the max between left and right -> last step would be on the root node
        When current node is None we return 0 -> if both left and right are None, the parent is a leaf node -> start adding 1 to the depth and keep backtracking

        TODO: try dfs approach where you pass the child node and the incrementing level to the inner helper
        and when reaching the leaf, update the result property if the level is greater than the current result.
